# Udacity Arcade Game Clone

## Overview
This is a basic arcade game clone created to fulfill a requirement for Udacity's Front-end Development course. There is a player character (horn girl) and three enemy characters (beetles). The player character starts on the middle grassy square in the bottom row. Using the up, down, left, and right arrow keys, the user moves the player character. The goal is to cross the path that the beatles are zooming across on without colliding with any of them and to reach the water (top row). If the player character collides with an enemy character, the game is reset and the player character is moved back to the bottom middle square. If the player character reaches the water, a "You win!!!" message appears at the top and the character is moved back to the bottom middle square.
